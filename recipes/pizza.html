        <li>1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>100ml passata</li>
        <li>handful fresh basil or 1 tsp dried</li>
        <li>125g ball mozzarella, sliced</li>
        <li>handful grated or shaved parmesan (or vegetarian alternative)</li>
        <li>handful of cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>handful of basil leaves (optional)</li>

        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong><em>Step 1</strong> </li> 
        <p>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl,
             then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, 
             pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and
              bring together with a wooden spoon until you have
               a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly 
               floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth.
                Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave
                 the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential
                  for a thin crust.
        </p>

    <li><strong><em>Step 2</strong> </li> 
        <p>Make the sauce: Mix the passata,
             basil and crushed garlic together, 
             then season to taste. Leave to stand at room
              temperature while you get on with shaping the base.
        </p> 
    <li><strong><em>Step 3</strong> </li> 
        <p> Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise,
             give it a quick knead, then split into two balls.
              On a floured surface, roll out the dough into 
              large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. 
              The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. 
              Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.
    </p>
<li><strong><em>Step 4</strong> </li> 
    <p>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8.
         Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray
          in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases
           with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes,
            drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on 
            its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake
             for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil,
              and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.
